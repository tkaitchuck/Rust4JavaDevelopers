The book is built using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) in markdown format.
To get started install `mdbook`:

cargo install mdbook
```

To preview the content locally you can run: `mdbook serve` and then point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

When you are done making changes build the book by running `mdbook build`.

To test code samples just run `cargo test`.
